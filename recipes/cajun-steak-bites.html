                <li>1 Tbsp paprika</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>

                <li>1/2 tsp light brown sugar</li>

            </ul>
    
    <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Slice steak into roughly 2" pieces and set aside in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong> In a small bowl, combine seasoning blend ingredients, then add to the mixing bowl with the steak bites, and toss to combine well.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat skillet:</strong> Heat a large heavy bottomed skillet over MED HIGH heat. Do this while the skillet is dry, and heat for several minutes, or until you see wisps of smoke.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear (in batches):</strong> 
                <ol>
                <li>Add 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan.</li>
                <li>Add about half the steak (adding less steak if the skillet isn't very big - making sure not to overcrowd the skillet).</li>
                <li>Sear for another 2 minutes without flipping, then flip over and sear another 2 minutes, until well browned. Set aside on a plate and repeat with remaining vegetable oil and steak bites.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make garlic butter:</strong> Reduce heat to MED LOW and use the same skillet (<em>Don't wash it - you want to keep all that flavor!</em>), and add butter. Once melted, add garlic and cook for about 30 seconds or so, using a wooden spoon to scrape browned bits from the pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine and serve:</strong>
                <ol>
                <li>Turn off the heat, add steak bits back to the skillet and stir well to combine with the garlic butter.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, with fresh minced parsley as garnish.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
