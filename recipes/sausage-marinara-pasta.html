    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sausage Marinara Pasta is not only a delicious meal to make, it's one that can be made in bulk to feed any large family.</p>
    <p>The best part about it is that it can be made as spicy, mild, sweet, or doused in garlic as you wish. I personally prefer to go heavy on garlic, medium spice, and mildy sweet.</p>
    <p>However, you're more than welcome to tweek the portions of the seasonings as you see fit. My only recommendation is to go easy on the Bay Leaves, while they add a great subtle flavor to your dish, adding one-too-many will leave your dish tasting bitter.</p>
    <p>When in doubt, add no more than one leaf for small sized pots, and no more than two leaves for any pot above medium size</p>
